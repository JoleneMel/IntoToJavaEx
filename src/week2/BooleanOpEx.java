		Some Observations:

		    The code above will compare our two variables:   ageRequiredToDrive and currentAge 
		    We use an if statement to determine if currentAge is greater than or equal to ageRequiredToDrive
		        If the value stored currentAge is greater than or equal to agetRequiredToDrive the result of the Boolean expression (the operation using the >= operator) based on the values assigned to those variables would evaluate to true 
		        If the value stored in currentAge was less than ageRequiredToDrive, then the result would be false. 
		    The result of the Boolean expression is assigned to the variable canPersonDrive and then printed to the console. In this case, the Boolean expression evaluates to false. 
		    Note:  If currentAge were 16, 17, or another higher number, it would evaluate to true


		List of Boolean operators that exist:

		    Less than:   <
		    Greater than:   >
		    Less than or equal to:   <=
		    Greater than or equal to:   >=
		    Equal (type matters):   ==
